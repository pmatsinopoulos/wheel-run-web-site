# Introduction

Heroku Add-on goes off on August 8th, 2022. Hence we have to replace it with another service.

# Which Service?

We decided to go with the [Heroku Data For Redis](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-redis).

# Steps We Followed

## CHANGE CONFIG TO USE REDIS\_URL

We had to change the config/cable.yml file to reference the `REDIS_URL` and not the `REDIS_TO_GO_URL`.

```yaml
# config/cable.yml
# ...
production:
  adapter: any_cable
  url: <%= ENV.fetch("REDIS_URL") { "redis://localhost:6379/1" } %>
  channel_prefix: wheel_run_backend_api_production
```

## DEPLOY NEW CONFIGURATION

After we created a PR and waited for the tests to run successfully, then we used the script:

```bash
$ ./bin/deploy.rb
```

to deploy to production.

Note: In the future, we might want to use Github actions to do the deployment.

## STOP DYNOS FROM RUNNING.

We wanted to make sure that the application is not servicing any clients.

First the Ruby on Rails server:

```bash
$ heroku ps:scale web=0 worker=0 --app wheel-run-backend-api
```

Then, the AnyCable (WebSockets) Server

```bash
$ heroku ps:scale web=0 --app wheel-run-backend-api-ws
```

## REMOVE THE OLD ADD-ON

Then we removed the old add-on:

```bash
$ heroku addons:destroy <redis-go-to-add-on-name> --app wheel-run-backend-api
```

## PROVISION THE NEW ADD-ON

```bash
$ heroku addons:create heroku-redis:hobby-dev --ap wheel-run-backend-api
```

## ATTACH THE NEW ADD-ON TO WEBSOCKET SERVER

```
$ heroku addons:attach wheel-run-backend-api::REDIS --app wheel-run-backend-api-ws
```

## RESTART DYNOS

On Ruby on Rails server app:

```bash
$ heroku ps:scale web=1 worker=1 --app wheel-run-backend-api
```

On AnyCable Web Sockets server app:

```bash
$ heroku ps:scale web=1 --app wheel-run-backend-api-ws
```

## MANUAL TESTS

After everything has been restarted, we did some manual tests using the mobile app.

# Closing Notes

The migration to the Heroku Data for Redis add-on was quite easy, with minimum disruption in our case.
