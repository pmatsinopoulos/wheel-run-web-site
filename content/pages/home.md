      Each service can have a task list with tasks that need to be carried out
      as part of a service execution. For example, a task to "Change Oil
      Engine".


      Each task in the list can also be assigned to an engineer in your
      workspace. Assignments notify the engineer and they know that they have to
      take care of this task to be done.

      can also assign individual tasks from each scheduled service. Keep
      accountability at any level you see more appropriate.

      Do your services based on scheduled services. The scheduled service is a
      service that you have planned in advance. When the time comes to do the
      service you rely on the details of the scheduled service.


      Add custom tasks to each service. Although the service relies on the
      scheduled service, you can always customize each particular service when
      the time comes to execute a scheduled service.

      Services are scheduled, but there are cases in which an unscheduled
      once-off repair might need to take place.


      Unscheduled Services have tasks and assignees too. Hence, they can be as
      detailed as the services are, only that they are not an instance of a
      scheduled service.
